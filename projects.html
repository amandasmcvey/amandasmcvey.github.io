                Stakeholders identified issues with application tables like a lack of space and subpar readability. <br/>
                I mitigated these issues by researching and applying best practices for data heavy tables, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Including only the necessary data. What data do users use most often? What data are users often comparing across builds?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Increasing scannability by aligning header text to bottom, aligning content text to top, numbers aligned right on decimal, all other text aligned left, and reducing bulky visuals.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Stakeholders identified an issue with determining a build's progress. <br/>
                I spoke to these stakeholders, gathered information on where the disconnect is, and developed several possible designs.  <br/>
                I went back to these stakeholders with the designs and gathered feedback, iterated on the designs, and repeated until a decision was reached.  <br/>
                These design changes included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing use of icons where text can be used to more quickly convey information instead of overloading the user's working memory.</li>
                    <li>Moving progress diagram from modal to directly on page so information is more accessible to users.</li>
                    <li>Combining two similar progress charts into one. Allowing users to compare and contrast more easily and reducing confusion as to why there are two progress charts.</li>
                    <li>Including additional descriptions and explanations to aid users who are unfamiliar with how builds progress.</li>

                Stakeholders identified an issue with the build request process.  <br/>
                The process was manual, error prone, and left out key information. Stakeholders requested a way to obtain the this information more effectively. <br/>
                I alleviated this issue by:<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing a form, a details page for each request, a list of requests.
                        <br/>The form included only the necessary and most important information. Details page included all the details entered in the form, user and time/date of submission and review, and a comments section. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Working to stakeholders to determine what information is needed for the team to create each type of build.</li>
                    <li>Creating a flow of form questions for each build type users are only shown relevant questions.</li>
                    <li>Utilizing a combination of proprietary design systems and best form practices, ensuring the form maintained usability, clarity, and efficiency. 
                        <br/> I used common terms and clear language, added information about terms with multiple names, broke form into related sections to reduce cognitive load, and kept questions and options inline for scannability. </li>
                    <li>Working with stakeholders to create build request process including states like: draft, submittable, ready for review, approve/deny, error, and archive. </li>
                </ul>

                This effort is a major addition to the cluster build workbook application mentioned above. Stakeholders identified a manual part of the build process that could be aided by the team's application. The goal is to further aid the managers with managing and tracking cluster builds from conception to completion.
                <br/>I alleviated this issue by:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Interviewing stakeholders and identified three distinct user types: manager, builder type 1, and builder type 2.
                        <br/>Synthesizing the data from the stakeholder interviews by using techniques like affinity diagramming, personas, and user flows. 
                        <br/>Stakeholders indicated that they enjoyed the kanban tool they currently used but a lot of the process was manual and tedious.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Brainstorming and researching possible design solutions and reverse brainstorming to ensure the ideas adequately represent user needs for each user type.
                        <br/>We decided on an integrated kanban board that interfaced with the application's API to automatically update each build, reducing manual effort.

                        <br/> This included custom swimlanes, kanban cards, and details pages which all that can be updated if the team's needs changed.

                A Figma library is a centralized collection of reusable design components, styles, and assets that can be shared across a team or organization. It serves as a single source of truth for design elements and promotes consistency, efficiency, and collaboration within the design process.
                <br/><br/>
                Some benefits of using a design library:
                <ul>
                    <li>Promotes consistency in design and brand identity.</li>
                    <li>Improves efficiency by allowing designers to quickly access and reuse common elements.</li>
                    <li>Facilitates collaboration and communication within the design team.</li>
                    <li>Streamlines the design process and enhances the overall user experience.</li>
                </ul>

                This library file includes spec sheets for each component, providing valuable information to developers for seamless implementation.

                Spec sheets include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <u>Detailed Component Specifications</u>: The spec sheets offer comprehensive details about each component, including dimensions, spacing, typography, color codes, and other important design attributes. Developers can refer to these specifications to ensure accurate and pixel-perfect implementation of the designs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Interaction Guidelines</u>: The spec sheets may also outline interaction behaviors, such as hover effects, transitions, or animations associated with the components. By following these guidelines, developers can replicate the intended user experience accurately.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Collaborative Communication</u>: Spec sheets act as a reference point for effective communication between designers and developers. If there are any questions or clarifications needed regarding the design, developers can refer to the spec sheets and provide feedback or seek clarification to ensure alignment.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                By leveraging the spec sheets provided in the Figma file, developers can streamline the development process, achieve design fidelity, and ensure a seamless transition from design to code.
